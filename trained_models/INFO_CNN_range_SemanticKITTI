TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATA is composed of projections extracted form semantically labeled point clouds downloaded from: http://www.semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html

Checkpoint after 353000 and 354000 iterations and ConsoleOutput in chekpoints folder.
Data composition:
Instances for classes 50 (building), 71 (tree trunk) and 80 (pole) were extracted by me (3DPointCloudClassificaion_GUI -prepare tab).
Classes 30 (person) and 10 (car) were already annoteted at the instance level. 

Classes 30 and 10 I cut from all sequances folders and merged them in here. Name convention:
ex. 02_000075_247 -> 02(sequence number)_000075(scene number within sequence)_247(instance number) 

For extracted classes:
Every object has a diff
