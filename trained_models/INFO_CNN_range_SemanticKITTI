TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATA is composed of projections extracted form semantically labeled point clouds downloaded from: http://www.semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html

Checkpoint after 353000 and 354000 iterations and ConsoleOutput in chekpoints folder.
Data composition:
Instances for classes 50 (building), 71 (tree trunk) and 80 (pole) were extracted by me (3DPointCloudClassificaion_GUI -prepare tab).
Classes 30 (person) and 10 (car) were already annoteted at the instance level. 

Classes 30 and 10 I cut from all sequances folders and merged them in here. Name convention:
ex. 02_000075_247 -> 02(sequence number)_000075(scene number within sequence)_247(instance number) 

For extracted classes:
Every object has a diffrent instance number, even if its the same object captured in diffrent image during capturing vehicle ride.

For classes descriptions look for /home/radek/DeepLearning/SemanticKITTI/ExtractObjects/CLASSES_INFO_semantic-kitti.yaml

number of objects:
car  		10 -> 74268+133980=208 248
person		30 -> 1253+6211=   7 464
building	50 -> 		   347 533
trunk		71 -> 		   105 636
pole		80 -> 		   67 458
