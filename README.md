## 3D Point Cloud Classification Pro\n\nThis is a utility created for classifying and exploring 3D point clouds while testing different classification models, segmentation, projection parameters, etc. It helps you prepare training data for your preferred models, offering the ability to generate 2D projections (binary or range) from 3D objects. For model training procedures, view the companion repository: 'ImageClassifier'. Testing was performed using point clouds from KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite[1] and IQmulus & TerraMobilita[2]. Efficiency varies with different datasets.\n\n### Supported functions:\n\t* Display point clouds - visualize classified objects with varying colors\n\t* Segment point cloud scenes\n\t* Generate (binary or range) projections of 3D point cloud objects\n\t* Classify scenes or specific objects to get class ID and neural net response vector\n\t* Create benchmark files for classified point clouds keeping to the Apollo 3D format\n\t* Save/load parameter configurations\n\t* Save/load clouds that fulfill specific requirements (class, min. neural net response, size)\n\t* Prepare training data by getting 2D projections (binary or range) from 3D objects\n\nCode is written in a way that facilitates easy functionality extension.\n\n### Usage:\n\t* Import point cloud scenes or objects (.pcd or .bin)\n\t* Highlight clouds for applying operations\n\t* Decide on parameters (segmentation, projection, classification model, benchmark type, etc.)\n\t* Execute required operation (view, segment, project, save operations, etc.)\n\n### Tested with dependencies:\n\tPCL 1.9, tensorflow-gpu 1.10, Qt 5.12, VTK-8.2.0, Python>=3.5 in Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04.\n\nFor AppImage users from releases, below dependencies are needed:\n\tPython >= 3.5, Tensorflow, Numpy\n\nto build:\n```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```\n\nOne can download the trained models from the 'release' tab. Move them to the trained_models folder to pair them with the example configurations.\n\n[1] Technology, Karlsruhe Institute of, 'The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite'\n\n[2] Vallet et al., 'TerraMobilita/iQmulus urban point cloud analysis benchmark', Computers and Graphics, 49, pp. 126-133, 2015.
